# Title: Challenging Fake Image Detection using GAN Models

In today's digital age, detecting fake or manipulated images has become increasingly challenging due to the advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These AI-powered tools have made it easier than ever to create convincing fake images that can deceive both human observers and traditional image analysis techniques. The problem at hand is to develop a robust and effective fake image detection system that can differentiate between genuine and manipulated images generated by GAN models.

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a fake image detection system capable of distinguishing between real and AI-generated images.

## Installation

Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
or 
use Google Collab Notebook

Required Libraries: You need to have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy: For numerical operations and array handling.
opencv-python (OpenCV): For image loading and manipulation.
scikit-learn: For machine learning utilities.
tensorflow and keras: For building and training neural networks.
You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn tensorflow

# Usage Guidelines for the Fake Image Detection System

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for running the fake image detection system using the provided Google Colab notebook. Before proceeding, please make sure you have access to the following resources:

**Google Chrome Browser:** To ensure compatibility and a seamless experience, it's recommended to use Google Chrome as your web browser.

**Google Colab Notebook:** The main tool for running the fake image detection system is the Google Colab notebook. You can access the notebook using the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ii5BVZULRcVZf9ElHyVVRlUdpsjz0Ffk?usp=sharing

**Dataset:** The dataset required for testing the system can be downloaded from Kaggle using this link: CIFake Real and AI-generated Synthetic Images Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images
Please note that only a portion of the dataset has been used in this notebook due to its large size.

**Now, let's get started with the usage instructions:**

**Step 1:** Open the Google Colab Notebook
Click on the provided link to access the Google Colab notebook.
You will be redirected to a Google Colab environment where you can execute the code.

**Step 2:** Authenticate and Mount Google Drive (if necessary)
Depending on the notebook's requirements, you might need to authenticate your Google account and mount Google Drive. Follow the on-screen prompts if this step is necessary.

**Step 3:** Upload the Dataset
Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
If you are instructed to upload the dataset to Google Colab, use the Colab's file upload feature to do so. This typically involves running a code cell to select and upload the dataset from your local machine to the Colab environment.

**Step 4:** Run the Notebook Cells
The notebook is divided into cells, each containing a portion of the code and explanations.
Start from the beginning and execute each cell sequentially. You can run a cell by clicking the "Run" button or using the Shift + Enter keyboard shortcut.
Follow any additional instructions provided within the notebook for configuring parameters, paths, or settings.

**Step 5:** Monitor Progress
As you run the cells, the notebook will display output, including progress updates and results.
Pay attention to any error messages or prompts that may require your input.
Step 6: Review Results

After running all the necessary cells, you should be able to review the results and outputs generated by the fake image detection system.
Analyze the system's performance and any visualizations or metrics provided in the notebook.

**Step 7:** Save and Share Results (if needed)
If you want to save the results or share them with others, you can export the notebook or save specific sections as needed.

**Step 8:** Terminate the Session (if needed)
Once you have completed your analysis, you can terminate the Colab session by closing the browser window or selecting "File" -> "Close" in the Colab environment.

These usage guidelines are designed to help you navigate and utilize the fake image detection system within the Google Colab environment. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully and refer to the notebook's documentation for any specific details related to the project.
